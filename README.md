- Art must be [critiqued](https://github.com/abikesa/bloom)
- Best of art uses history:
  - Reverence
  - Inference
  - Deliverance
- Case: Bach's `Air`
  - My `reverence` for him is [increased by it](https://github.com/abikesa/sheetmusic)
  - Yet its mostly my new `inferences` about music in general that dominate my experience
  - From this vantage I'm in better position to critique and provide much needed `deliverance` from the shackles of my earlier exposures to music & genres
